This is the major part of a derivative pricing project.

Key content:
1. Built OIS curve for each day using GBP swap rates over different maturities, from 1 week to 50 years.
2. Fit NSS model to bond Z-spreads and obtained time series of 𝛽s from these fits representing the level, slope, and curvature.
3. Used z-scores to detect significant changes and outliers in 𝛽s and observed impacts of central bank rate adjustments, financial instability events, and geopolitical factors on bond valuations.
